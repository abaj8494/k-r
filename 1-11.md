I'd do some testing against the UNIX `wc` program.
Doing so reveals that our word-count program ./1-8.c counts extra spaces. I suspect it does so because a tab is also equivalent to 4 spaces.

Bugs could be caused by early EOF characters, non-newline terminated inputs and (maybe) null terminated inputs.
